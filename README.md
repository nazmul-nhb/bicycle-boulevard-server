# Bicycle Boulevard Server üö≤

A comprehensive backend API built with **Express** and **TypeScript**, designed for managing a bicycle store with MongoDB and Mongoose. This project supports CRUD operations for bicycles and orders, features advanced error handling, and ensures data integrity through schema validation. For Input validation `Zod` is used. Created a class `UnifiedError` with multiple private methods to process different types of errors.

## Features

### üö¥ Bicycle Management

- Create, read, update, and delete bicycles.
- Search for bicycles by name, brand, or type.
- Supports categories such as Mountain, Road, Hybrid, BMX, and Electric.

### üì¶ Order Management

- Place orders with customer `email` and product (bicycle) `id`.
- Automatically adjust stock quantities and availability based on orders.
- Prevent orders if stock is insufficient.

### üìä Revenue Insights

- Calculate total revenue from all orders using MongoDB aggregation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling

- Unified error responses for `validation` (mostly `zod` and `MongoDB`), `duplication`, `casting` (MongoDB `ObjectId`), and `parsing`, `insufficient`, `not found` and almost every possible types of errors.
- Clear and structured error messages to facilitate debugging.
